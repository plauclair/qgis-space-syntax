<plauclair> it seems like getFeatures gets all attributes in addition to geometry, is it possible to only get geometry?

<plauclair> thanks! I was getting exponential run times ;)

<plauclair> turns out updating unsupported scripts is a great way to get to learn :)
<plauclair> it seems like using changeAttributeValue() has pretty big performance impacts in a for loop, is there anything faster that I should use?

<plauclair> problem is, the answer doesn't provide code and I'm not familiar enough with the API to fully understand how to change the code..

<NathanW> what you are doing is right
<NathanW> you sure there is a performance hit in that section?
* dassouki (~ahmed@142.162.176.18) a rejoint #qgis
<plauclair> hmm, seems right now
<plauclair> I don't know why, I ran it once and it took nearly 30 seconds
<plauclair> I just ran the same code after forcequitting QGIS and it runs at about 2 seconds
* mbernasocchi est parti (Quit: ciao)
<plauclair> this is only a small test case, but I was wondering if storing each value in a dict and then updating with changeAttributeValues() would provide any improvement
<NathanW> plauclair: well nothing is commited until layer.commitChanges()
<plauclair> ok, good to know :)
<NathanW> so what I would do is wrap that for loop in a timing method to check
<NathanW> import time
<NathanW> start = time.time()
<NathanW> end = time.time() - start
<NathanW> put start before the for block and end after, but before the commit
<plauclair> NathanW,  yes, I want to figure out timing for different parts of the code some time later

<plauclair> by the way, the maintainer of the original plugin isn't responding to my emails and seems to have abandoned the plugin, how do I update it in the repos then?
<NathanW> plauclair: I can give you admin rights to it
<plauclair> ok, I'll ask you when I've done a few more changes
<NathanW> in favor of transparency could you send a email to me but cc the dev list just explain that the author isn't answering emails and you have a updated version for 2.0
<plauclair> yes, I'll email the dev one last time to make sure and then do that
<NathanW> ok cool
<plauclair> I still need to change the code so it runs ok on very large data sets, right now it just fills memory, I'd rather make the attribute change iterative
<NathanW> just so that other people know what is going on and it doesn't look like a hijack
<plauclair> yep
<plauclair> one last small thing, before all the loops the plugin adds attributes, but on the first run I cannot seem to write in it, all the fields are marked as null, is there anything special I should do?
<NathanW> strange, one sec
* ginetto est parti (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
<NathanW> that script is really messy :S
<NathanW> (not your fault I know)
<NathanW> try moving layer.startEditing to after the new fields
<plauclair> that and the turkish variable names ;)
<NathanW> yesh
<NathanW> yes
<plauclair> well, that did the trick!
<plauclair> thanks a lot!
<NathanW> all those getFeatures are going to add up
<plauclair> what would you recommend?
<NathanW> mainly because they are not needed
<NathanW> well obj is just the layer feature count so you could just iterate over the whole layer
<NathanW> like this

<NathanW> lines 224-245
<plauclair> thanks!
<plauclair> I'll be implementing that on those loops
<NathanW> it should speed things up a little bit
<NathanW> and that for beat in features2: loop can be done using a spatialindex so you don't have to look up each feature each time
<NathanW> in fact I have written a post about that topic http://nathanw.net/2013/01/04/using-a-qgis-spatial-index-to-speed-up-your-code/

<plauclair> really appreciate your help
<NathanW> no worries
<plauclair> 2 weeks ago I couldn't even write any python, now I'm trying to maintain this plugin..
<NathanW> well this one will be a good one to learn on because it's a mess :)

<plauclair> yes, I happen to have seen that first one yesterday
<plauclair> I was pretty impressed by xrange
* volaya est parti (Quit: volaya)
<NathanW> yeah it's handy
<plauclair> I've been developping in PHP for nearly 4-5 years now, I really appreciate how python does everything
<plauclair> every time I have to go back to my php code for different stuff I maintain, I cringe ;)
<NathanW> good old php

<plauclair> I'll probably end up changing all that code, but I need to teach myself graphs before that, I've seen a few algorithms I want to implement
<plauclair> at least getting that one up to speed is a good start to learn QGIS python
<plauclair> got to go, thank again, I'll be  contacting you when I'm satisfied with the changes, bye!
<NathanW> plauclair: catch ya
